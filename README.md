We archive repos for one or more of the following reasons:
- Code or content is unmaintained, and therefore might be broken
- Content is outdated, and therefore may mislead readers
- Code or content evolved into something else and/or has lived on in a different place
- The repository or project is not active in general

Please note that in order to keep the primary IPFS GitHub org tidy, most archived repos are moved into the [ipfs-inactive](https://github.com/ipfs-inactive) org.
